# A YouTube playlist MP3 converter<br>that can also shazam, tag and play songs

PYPL2MP3 is a Python program that allows you to download audio tracks from YouTube videos for entire playlists and store them in MP3 format on your computer with Shazam-confirmed ID3 tags and proper cover art.

The program works from the command line. Nevertheless, it is crafted to be friendly, offering a clean and pleasant user experience.

## Features

PYPL2MP3 offers the following features:

- Import songs of YouTube playlists in MP3 format 
- Automatically "shazam" songs to get and set confirmed ID3 tags with proper cover art
- Manually set or fix ID3 tags and manage "junk" songs (no match found on Shazam)
- List imported songs and playlists with detailed information
- Play MP3 songs from CLI and open related videos in your default web browser
- Filter and sort songs via fuzzy search in MP3 playlists


## Limitations

PYPL2MP3 has the following limitations:

- Only public YouTube playlists can be imported.
- Videos restricted to countries that do not match yours are excluded from import.
- Uploading an age-restricted video will fail but will not prevent other videos in the playlist from being downloaded and converted.


## Requirements

PYPL2MP3 run under Python 3 (version `3.7` or higher) and uses `pytubefix` package under the hood.


### Package manager

PYPL2MP3 requires `poetry` to manage its dependencies. So you need it to install the program on your computer ([install instructions here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)).


### Audio framework

To perform MP3 conversion and to set ID3 tags to MP3 files, PYPL2MP3 needs `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` binaries to be installed on your computer (see [FFmpeg website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)).


### Proof of origin token

To access YouTube audio streams, a "proof of origin token" (POT) is required. Otherwise PYPL2MP3 may be banned as a bot.

This token is generated by BotGuard third-party program to attest the requests are coming from a genuine client. It needs you have `nodejs` installed on your computer to run ([install instructions here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)). 

**Note:** Support for automatic generation of POT is available from the version `8.12` of `pytubefix` ([more details here](https://pytubefix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/po_token.html)).


## Installation

Once `poetry` installed, type the following command to install PYPL2MP3 dependencies:
```sh
poetry install
```


## Configuration

PYPL2MP3 works out of the box. It does not need any configuration file nor use a database. 

By default, PYPL2MP3 store imported playlists in a folder named `pypl2mp3` on your $HOME directory. If this does not suit your needs, you can set the environment variable `PYPL2MP3_DEFAULT_REPOSITORY_PATH` to the path where you want imported playlists to be stored. This will avoid you to pass this path via the `--repo` option to the PYPL2MP3 commands.

In the same way, if you regularly import songs from a favorite YouTube playlist you use to add newly discovered songs, you can define it as your default playlist by setting its YouTube ID in the environment variable `PYPL2MP3_DEFAULT_PLAYLIST_ID`. This will avoid you to pass this ID as argument or option to the PYPL2MP3 commands.

To set your default repository path and your default YouTube playlist for current shell and all processes started from it, type the following in your terminal:
```sh
export PYPL2MP3_DEFAULT_REPOSITORY_PATH="</full/path/to/your/repository>"
export PYPL2MP3_DEFAULT_PLAYLIST_ID="<Your favorite YouTube playlist ID>"
```

To set them permanently for all future terminal sessions, add the same instructions to your `.bashrc` file (or `.zshrc` and so on) in your $HOME directory.


## Execution

To run a PYPL2MP3 command, type the following in your terminal, from the root folder of this package (the folder containing this README file):
```sh
poetry run pypl2mp3 <command> [options]
```

Or, more convenient, call the following shell script from any location of your computer without having to leave your current working directory to execute the `poetry` command:
```sh
sh /absolute/or/relative/path/to/pypl2mp3.sh <command> [options]
```


## Usage

Run a command:
```sh
pypl2mp3 <command> [options]
```

List all the avaible commands:
```sh
pypl2mp3 --help
```

Get usage for a particular command:
```sh
pypl2mp3 <command> --help
```


## Commands

PYPL2MP3 provides the following commands:

## Troubleshooting

If you experiment some issues, notably when importing song (command `Ã¬mport`) or adding ID3 tags to MP3 files (command `tag`), it is probably due to recent changes on YouTube side. In this case, try to update the `pytubefix` package to its latest version.

To do so, run the following command in your terminal from the root folder of this project:
```sh
poetry add pytubefix@latest
```
